      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <a>
        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
        other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
        knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy
        and freedom. But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s
        simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage
        powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and
        end-to-end encryption. Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely
        decentralized.
      </a>
    </div>
    <div>
      We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a network
      to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.

      <h2>Introducing PiedPiperCoin</h2>
      <a>
        Pied Piper's new internet is built for users, by users. You supply the
        storage, compute, and networking resources that power our entire
        decentralized web.

        that is! The more you share your device resources, the more
        PiedPiperCoin you receive. Whether you're a developer with an app ready
        for market, or just an Average Joe with a smartphone you'll love all you
        can do with PiedPiperCoin.
