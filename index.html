      <div>
        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
        other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
        knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy
        and freedom. But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s
        simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage
        powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and
        end-to-end encryption. Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely
        decentralized.

        We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a
        network to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.

        that is! The more you share your device resources, the more
        PiedPiperCoin you receive. Whether you're a developer with an app ready
        for market, or just an Average Joe with a smartphone you'll love all you
